This is an example file for the raw format. Every line that does not start with a "[" will be ignored. Statements always span one line, and are contained within "[" and "]". Everything following the closing bracket is not interpreted.

The DEFINE keyword starts an entity template definition. The definition ends with the END keyword.

[DEFINE:CREATURE]
    Indentation is useful to keep it readable, but not required.

    A new component can be added using the component name:

    [BODY]

    After a component was added, it can be modified using the component call method:

    [BODY:HEAD] (Now the body knows it should have a head)

    The above component call will run the following D code:
    bodyComponent.call([Argument(Id.HEAD)]);
    The body component will add the head subcomponent.

    If the component does not yet exist, it is created automatically.

    [NAME:"gnome":"gnomes"]
    
    The above is equivalent to:

    [NAME]
    [NAME:"gnome":"gnomes"]

    To remove a component, use the "-" prefix:

    [-BODY] (the body component is being removed)

[END]

An entity template can copy another template by specifying a second parameter in DEFINE:

[DEFINE:GNOME:CREATURE]
    Gnome stuff goes here.
[END]
